# KiCad_BOM_Editor
Export component fields as CVS and import CVS to add/change/remove field values and names. Based on BPJWES/KiCAD_Partslist_editor, whithout restriction to fieldnames. Working concept, not a finished product.

Fieldnames are automaticly found, and orderd. So this should work with any field naming method.
